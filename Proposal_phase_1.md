<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p>SNA: Network is a bundle of modules for network algorithms, specifically designed for the needs of Social Network Analysis (SNA), but can be used for any other graph algorithms. It represents a standard directed and weighted network, which can also be used as an undirected and/or unweighted network of course.</p>
