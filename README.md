<h3> Group Description: </h3>
<p> SSNA::Network is a bundle of modules for network algorithms, specifically designed for the needs of Social Network Analysis (SNA), but can be used for any other graph algorithms of course. It represents a standard directed and weighted network, which can also be used as an undirected and/or unweighted network of course.We are looking forward to get a company's data and find the relationship between the people using SNA graph theory concept.</p>
