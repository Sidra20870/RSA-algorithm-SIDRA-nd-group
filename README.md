## Project Description
SNA::Network is a bundle of modules for network algorithms, specifically designed for the needs of Social Network Analysis (SNA), but can be used for any other graph algorithms of course. It represents a standard directed and weighted network, which can also be used as an undirected and/or unweighted network of course.We are looking forward to get a company's data and find the relationship between the people using SNA graph theory concept

##Discrete Math Concepts Used ##
*Graph theory using social network analysis
*Analyze any data from network social media
*Long time existence
*Mapping :
    * goods
    * services
    * Relation or information between
          * People
          * Team
          * Organization
