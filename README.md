<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;"> SNA::Network is a bundle of modules for network algorithms, specifically designed for the needs of Social Network Analysis (SNA), but can be used for any other graph algorithms of course. It represents a standard directed and weighted network, which can also be used as an undirected and/or unweighted network of course.We are looking forward to get a company's data and find the relationship between the people using SNA graph theory concept </p>

<h2>Discrete Math Concepts Used </h2>
<ul>
     <li>*Graph theory using social network analysis</li>
     <li>*Analyze any data from network social media</li>
     <li>*Long time existence</li>
     <li>*Mapping :</li>
     <ul>
          <li>* goods</li>
          <li>* services</li>
          <li> * Relation or information between</li>
          <ul>
               <li>* People</li>
               <li>* Team </li>
               <li>* Organization</li>
          </ul>
     </ul>
</ul>
<h2> Problem Faced </h2>
<p>We have use networkx built in functions which was much difficult to understand but with the help of internet and understand their meta data we overcome this problem. We was facing communication problem among project partners beside this, this library contain limit functions which cause us to think how to distribute functions between the partners. So we decided each partner will do 2-3 functions.  </p>
